/**
 * Intelligence scan status machine (server-side owner).

 * Mirrors `ScanStatus` from @restropulse/shared verbatim. The web mirror lives at

 * module CLAUDE.md §10 rule these two files change together or not at all.
 *
 * Linear happy path:
 *   QUEUED → FETCHING_PLACES → ANALYZING → SCORING → COMPLETED
 * Any non-terminal stage may transition to FAILED. COMPLETED and FAILED are
 * terminal. Pure functions — unit tested in tests/unit/intelligence-scan-status.test.ts.
